# Backend Score Validation and Duplication Prevention Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of backend score validation and duplication prevention as requested.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Backend Score Validation
- **Score Limits**: Maximum 1000 points per request
- **Rate Limits**: Maximum 500 points per second
- **Game State Validation**: Scores must match game state data
- **Level-Based Validation**: Scores are validated against player level

### 2. Duplication Prevention
- **Hash-Based Detection**: Unique hash created for each score submission
- **Time-Based Expiration**: Duplicate entries expire after 10 minutes
- **Multi-Parameter Hashing**: Uses player address, score amount, and game state hash

### 3. Session Token Security
- **Game State Binding**: Tokens are bound to specific game states
- **30-Second Refresh**: Tokens refresh every 30 seconds
- **Per-Game Session**: Tokens are specific to each game session

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Per-Player Limits**: Only 1 save score per game session
- **High Score Limits**: Additional restrictions for high scores
- **Request Throttling**: General API request rate limiting

## Technical Implementation

### Rate Limiter Enhancements (`app/lib/rate-limiter.ts`)
- Added `validateScoreSubmission()` function for comprehensive score validation
- Enhanced `isDuplicateScoreSubmission()` with timestamp-based hashing
- Added `cleanupExpiredEntries()` for memory management

### API Route Updates (`app/api/update-player-data/route.ts`)
- Integrated enhanced validation functions
- Added game state consistency checks
- Improved error handling and logging

### Session Management (`app/lib/auth.ts`)
- Enhanced token validation with game state binding
- Added multiple validation attempts for token verification
- Improved development mode token handling

## Validation Rules

### Score Validation
1. Score amounts must be non-negative
2. Maximum score per request: 1000 points
3. Maximum transactions per request: 1
4. Maximum score progression: 500 points per second
5. Scores must match game state data
6. Scores must be reasonable for player level

### Duplication Prevention
1. Unique hash based on player address, score, and game state
2. 10-minute duplicate detection window
3. Automatic cleanup of expired entries
4. Immediate rejection of duplicate submissions

### Session Security
1. Tokens refresh every 30 seconds
2. Tokens bound to game state (level, score)
3. IP-based token validation
4. Strict validation in production, lenient in development

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Valid scores are accepted
- Invalid scores are rejected with appropriate error messages
- Duplicate submissions are detected and prevented
- Session tokens are properly validated
- Rate limits are enforced

## Security Features
- Anti-cheat mechanisms to prevent score manipulation
- Request deduplication to prevent replay attacks
- Browser header validation to detect automated tools
- Behavior pattern analysis to identify suspicious activity
- Game state hashing to verify client-side integrity

This implementation provides robust backend validation and duplication prevention while maintaining a good user experience for legitimate players.
